Preprocessor to generate LaTeX-beamer code from a more compact language.

The needs for a new sub language were:
- compactness: so as to remove type as few formatting informations as possible,
- expressiveness: allow to format most beamer frames with clear and short syntax,
- flexibility: allowance for LaTeX without to much overhead.

Features:
- Indentations are compulsory and significant
- new sections and their titles are introduced by 's Section title'
- new frames and their titles are introduced by '+ Frame title'
- new blocks and their titles are introduced by 'b Block title'
- new columns are introduced with a width (proportion to \columnwidth) by 'c{ratio}'
- items are introduced by '- item text' with automatic environment creation
- figures are included by 'f{ratio}{filename}'
- frames, blocks, figures and items can have the <...> beamer directives: '+<+-> frame title' or '-<+-> item text'
- everything else is reproduced verbatim

Example:
"""
+ Example 1
    b<+-> Example block
        - first item
            - subitem
            - other subitem
        - second item
    b<+-> second block
        c{0.4}
            f<3->{0.8}{figure1.png}
        c{0.6}
            Some generic text:
            - and items
"""
translates into
"""
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Example 1}
    \begin{block}<+->
        \begin{itemize}
            \item first item
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item subitem
                    \item other subitem
                \end{itemize}
            \item second item
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}<+->
        \begin{columns}
            \column{0.4\columnwidth}
            \includegraphics<3->[width=0.8\columnwidth]{figure1.png}
            \column{0.6\columnwidth}
            Some generic text:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item and items
            \end{itemize}
        \end{columns}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}
